# LinearRegression 
LinearRegression (Supervised model) is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statics, used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
  In the LinearRegression.py, we focus on simple linear regression, where we predict house prices based on their sizes

The primary objectives of this laboratory:
  1. Implement the linear regression model in Python
  2. Explore the effets of weight (w) and bias (b) on model predictions
  3. Visualize the relationship between input features and target variables
  4. Make predictions using the implemented model
  5. Implement the Cost Function
